###### IoT data streams

After starting out with Particle Photons, I wanted somewhere to log my data.
Phant seemed like the perfect fit, but it's written in Node, if you want to alter a stream it kills everything you've sampled so far, and it's just awkward to get along with.
So now I'm doing my own thing, based on containers. Crate runs the DB, and <insert favourite language> will control the data flowing into the system, and how it is displayed.
I hope to get an iOS client running in Swift as well, mostly so I can keep track of how my home sensors are doing.
